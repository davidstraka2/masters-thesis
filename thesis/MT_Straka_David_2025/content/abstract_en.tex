This thesis deals with the design, implementation, and testing of an open and decentralized architecture of a general-purpose reservation system. The thesis first features an overview of select existing reservation systems and a requirements analysis. It then designs a suitable architecture, booking client application, and its back end, which is designed to support a common HTTP-based booking protocol. Lastly, an implementation of the design is presented, along with the results of its testing and evaluation.
