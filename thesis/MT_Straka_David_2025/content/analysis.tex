This chapter includes the analysis of functional and non-functional requirements for the system to be designed and implemented.

The requirements are based on both the assignment of the thesis, the overview of select existing reservation systems in the previous chapter~\ref{part:existing_reservation_systems}, and on original ideas for the new system.
