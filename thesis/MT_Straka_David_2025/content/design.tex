This chapter describes the design of the proposed and implemented system. First it details the architecture, including the architecture of the decentralized booking system overall, the format of the booking addresses which are used to uniquely identify users within the system and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) scheme which is to be used for distinguishing the booking addresses from other similar identifiers, and the architecture of the implementation in this thesis. Then the chapter describes the HTTP-based booking protocol which is used to communicate between different booking services. Lastly, the chapter describes the design of the individual back-end services and client application.
