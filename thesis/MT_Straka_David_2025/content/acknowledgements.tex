I would like to start by thanking my supervisor, doc. Ing. Tomáš Vitvar, Ph.D., for his guidance and support throughout my work on this thesis, as well as for the time he dedicated to the consultations needed especially during the formative stages of the process. Furthermore, I would like to thank my family and friends for their support. Last but not least, I want to express my gratitude to the authors of the many tools and libraries that were used during my work on the thesis, as well as to the open source community as a whole.
