The booking client application shall use a single page application (SPA) architecture. The SPA architecture is a design pattern that allows the client application to load a single HTML page and dynamically update the page as the user interacts with the application. This design pattern allows the client application to be more responsive and provide a better user experience.

The client application will be a progressive web application (PWA) that can be installed on the user's device and possibly even work offline (though that will not be implemented as of now). This will also enable the use of the custom booking URL schema (on supported platforms). And as any web application, it will be accessible on many different devices and platforms.

Lastly, it will be a mobile-first design to ensure that the application is usable on mobile devices.

Initially, the Figma design tool was used to create wireframes of the UI, however, the UI has changed by a not significant amount since then, so the original design is left out of the thesis.
