The API gateway behaves to the outside worlds as a booking service. It lets anybody access the booking protocol APIs of the booking service, but only authenticated users to use to internal APIs meant for the booking client app.

Much like the booking service, the API gateway was built around the framework NestJS (Nest), with Express enabled.

For user authentication, the library SuperTokens was used. For proxying requests to booking service, the library http-proxy-middleware was used.

The API gateway also provides on internal endpoint \texttt{POST /forward-booking-request} for use by the booking service only, which is used to forward booking requests from the booking service to remote booking services.
